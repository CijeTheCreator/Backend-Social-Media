The representatives of all ITU branches here present
All other members of ITU 
Our greetings. We wish to thank God for bringing us together once again to this annual gathering of the illusious sons of Imufu. We also thank God for safe journey he granted all the reprensentatives from all the branches. Indeed he is a great God.
Imufu has been known to be a pace setter in all ramification especially in the area of peace, togetherness and development. No wonder other communities in Enugu Ezike use Imufu as an example each time they talk about these aforementioned attitudes. These attributes were made possible by some with the support of all of Imufu’s illustrious sons who understand the saying by Ban ki-mon that “sustainable development is the pathway to the future we want for all. It offers a framework to generate economic growth, achieve social justice, exercise environmental stewardship and strengthen governance”, and according to Harvey Firestaone, “the growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.
Imufu cannot forget the likes of Ihgume Remigius Attah, Gregory Abugueke… who spent their energy, time and risked their names while collecting levies imposed on every som of this community when the community thought it wise to have wades for all its eligible sons and daughters. With their effors joined to other contributions from Okete and others who had national commeeties, Imufu had borehole which is serving all Imufu and beyond.
Today, efforts is being threatened by our collective decision. Decision to allow individual to connect water to their various houses. Though the decision was made to generate more funds to run and maintatin the borehole but we have all seen that instead of generating funds we are now increasing more expenses.
Reports are bound where those that connected the water construct underground tanks and as water is being pumped to the general tank in the borehold, the water goes straight to individuals underground and overhead tanks so, the poor individuals will not see water. Some, their tank will get filled and they will not off it and so, water will finish before you know it.
We have had cases where the pipes that is used to connect these water gets burst or broken along the road, and it took days if not weeks to fix. A woman conceiving without having sexual intercourse or artificial insemination to contail all these leakages of water.
In all these, you will understand that it will be as difficult as there are the few examples we can see; what if somebody’s tap is faulty inside his bathroom and water is leaking continiusly thereby wasting water? Just to mention one among many unseen processes or places water could be going unchecked.
We have identified three major negative side effects of individuals connecting water from the Imufu borehole
