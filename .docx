The Chairman of all branches of ITU here present
The representatives of all ITU branches here present
All other members of ITU 
Our greetings. We wish to thank God for bringing us together once again to this annual gathering of the illusious sons of Imufu. We also thank God for safe journey he granted all the reprensentatives from all the branches. Indeed he is a great God.
Imufu has been known to be a pace setter in all ramification especially in the area of peace, togetherness and development. No wonder other communities in Enugu Ezike use Imufu as an example each time they talk about these aforementioned attitudes. These attributes were made possible by some with the support of all of Imufu’s illustrious sons who understand the saying by Ban ki-mon that “sustainable development is the pathway to the future we want for all. It offers a framework to generate economic growth, achieve social justice, exercise environmental stewardship and strengthen governance”, and according to Harvey Firestaone, “the growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.
Imufu cannot forget the likes of Ihgume Remigius Attah, Gregory Abugueke… who spent their energy, time and risked their names while collecting levies imposed on every som of this community when the community thought it wise to have wades for all its eligible sons and daughters. With their effors joined to other contributions from Okete and others who had national commeeties, Imufu had borehole which is serving all Imufu and beyond.
Today, efforts is being threatened by our collective decision. Decision to allow individual to connect water to their various houses. Though the decision was made to generate more funds to run and maintatin the borehole but we have all seen that instead of generating funds we are now increasing more expenses.
Reports are bound where those that connected the water construct underground tanks and as water is being pumped to the general tank in the borehold, the water goes straight to individuals underground and overhead tanks so, the poor individuals will not see water. Some, their tank will get filled and they will not off it and so, water will finish before you know it.
We have had cases where the pipes that is used to connect these water gets burst or broken along the road, and it took days if not weeks to fix. A woman conceiving without having sexual intercourse or artificial insemination to contail all these leakages of water.
In all these, you will understand that it will be as difficult as there are the few examples we can see; what if somebody’s tap is faulty inside his bathroom and water is leaking continiusly thereby wasting water? Just to mention one among many unseen processes or places water could be going unchecked.
We have identified three major negative side effects of individuals connecting water from the Imufu borehole:
1.	The submersible pump (literally known as Sumo) will be stressed. You will agree with us that with all the connected waters into individual homes, that the borehole will run on daily basis if not continuously to satisfy all that needs water. By so doing the lifespan of the Sumo will be reduced.
2.	Let us shock you, the estimated cost of the sumo in Imufu borehole is not less than 1m – 1.5m. If we are to replace it. Also, to get such original or quality one is a difficult task it is still available in the market.
3.	As the borehole is required to run always to satisfy all, the generator/lister is put under pressure which will require frequent servicing and in a short while replacement. All these involves money which we don’t think the community has.
4.	You will lalso agree with us that the connection of water to the individual homes have made the community to be underdeveloped. You may ask how. If we did not approve the connection of water to individual homes, we would have had about 10 boreholes at least built by individuals in their various haomes , but today how many people in Imufu have their personal borehole water supply source?
History has it that throughout the existence of Umueegama borehole, no individual connected water to their houses and the borehole lasted over 4 decades as we can recall.
Also, go to Oguete now, there are over 20 personal boreholes existing in Oguete where if the central borehole gets faulty, the citizens can use them as an alternative.
My brothers, we have looked at this issue of water critically and we have come to understand that there is need to disconnect all water connections going to individual houses including churches and other organisations.
This sole water source of the community was supposed to serve those that cannot sink borehole, that is those considered to be poor among us, but now, such is not the case.
My brothers imagine what will happen to our aged parents, who are at home when the Imufu borehole is said not to be working. They will spend fuel @250 per liter to o and fetch water in the neigbouring community, or pay individuals or tanker drivers to bring water for them at N10,000 per tank.
In Conclusion, we Nsukka branch of ITU is strongly saying that Imufu should disconnect all water going to individual houses with immediate effect to quench this fire that is about to start.
